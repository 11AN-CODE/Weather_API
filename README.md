# Weather API üå§Ô∏è
This is a web application that provides real-time weather data. It's built with Node.js and Express.js and demonstrates how to integrate with a third-party API, use a front-end templating engine, and handle user authentication.
Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API
Use a library like axios or the built-in fetch to make a GET request to this URL.

‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing.

Protected Routes: Weather data is only accessible to authenticated users.

Third-Party API Integration: Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Templating: Renders dynamic content using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for a clean user interface.

Environment Variables: Securely manages sensitive information like the API key using environment variables.
